        <div class="orangetext">The Cornish Rex is an adventurous animal that readily adapts to new situations and environments.
          It will explore wherever - and whenever - it can.
          It often will be seen jumping into or onto refrigerators, examining washing machines or climbing into open clothes driers.</div>

        <div class="orangetitle">Children & Other Pets</div>
        <div class="orangetext">The active and social Cornish Rex is a perfect choice for families with children and cat-friendly dogs.
          He will play fetch as well as any retriever, learns tricks easily and loves the attention he receives from children who treat him politely and with respect. </div>
